        <h2 class="case-title">Ocean Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Public and Institutional Perceptions</h2>
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080442761501264">
            Case Study 1
        </a>
        <p class="case-description">This case study delves into the complex realm of ocean carbon sequestration, with a focus on understanding the public and institutional perceptions surrounding this innovative approach to mitigating climate change. Carbon sequestration in the ocean involves capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) in marine environments, such as the deep ocean or coastal ecosystems, to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels and combat global warming.</p>

            Case Study 2
        </a>
        <p class="case-description">This comprehensive research article delves into the intricate relationship between anthropogenic climate change and the dynamics of North Atlantic phytoplankton communities. Through extensive data analysis and field observations, the study reveals compelling evidence of significant shifts and reconfigurations in phytoplankton assemblages, which play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem and the Earth's carbon cycle.</p>
